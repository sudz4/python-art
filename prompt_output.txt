There was a man who lived in the mountains who was said to be 500 years old. No one knew for sure because he never told anyone his age. He was a hermit who lived in a small cabin in the woods and only came out to get food and supplies every few weeks. He was a very kind man and would often help people who got lost in the woods. He knew every plant and animal in the area, and was said to be able to communicate with them. Some people even said he had magical powers. He was always happy to help anyone who needed it and was a very wise man.
